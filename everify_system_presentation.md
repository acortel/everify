# **eVerify Integration System Presentation**

## **What is eVerify Integration?**

**eVerify** is a government service that verifies people's identities using their personal information and face recognition. Our system makes it easy to add this verification feature to any desktop application.

---

## **How It Works (Simple Overview)**

### **The Problem:**
- Different organizations need to verify people's identities
- Each organization has their own desktop applications and data needs
- Adding verification to each app separately is expensive and time-consuming

### **Our Solution:**
- **One reusable eVerify package** that works with any desktop application
- **Simple button integration** - just add a "Verify" button to your app
- **Automatic face verification** - uses camera to confirm identity
- **Smart checking** - skips verification for people already verified

---

## **Data Handling (Important Clarification)**

### **What eVerify Stores:**
- **Basic verification info** (name, birth date, face image)
- **Purpose**: Only to check if someone is already verified
- **Benefit**: Avoids duplicate verifications for the same person

### **What Your Application Handles:**
- **Your specific business data** (customer records, applications, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Your organization's normal operations
- **Benefit**: Each application can use verification data differently

### **Example:**
- **Bank Application**: Uses verification to confirm identity, then stores customer account data
- **Government Office**: Uses verification to confirm identity, then processes service applications
- **Insurance Company**: Uses verification to confirm identity, then creates policy records

## **Step-by-Step Integration Process**

### **Step 1: Prepare the eVerify Package**
- Run our packaging tool (one command)
- Creates a complete eVerify application with all features
- Includes face recognition, database storage, and user interface

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Database**
- Create a simple database table to store verification results
- Each organization gets their own separate database
- Keeps verification data secure and organized

### **Step 3: Add a Button to Your Application**
- Add a "Verify Identity" button to your desktop application
- When users click this button, the eVerify system opens
- Users can enter personal information or scan a QR code

### **Step 4: Smart Verification Process**
- System first checks if person is already verified
- If already verified: Shows face image and skips verification
- If not verified: Proceeds with full verification process

### **Step 5: Face Verification Process**
- User enters their information (name, birth date, etc.)
- System opens a web page for face verification
- User takes a photo using their computer's camera
- System confirms the person is real (not a photo of a photo)

### **Step 6: Complete Verification**
- System sends information to government eVerify service
- Government confirms the person's identity
- Results are stored in verification database (for future checks)
- Your application receives the verification result and handles its own data needs

## **What Users See (Simple User Experience)**

### **For End Users:**
1. **Click "Verify" button** in your application
2. **System checks** if already verified
3. **If already verified**: Shows face image, verification complete
4. **If not verified**: Enter personal information (name, birth date)
5. **Take a photo** using computer camera
6. **Wait for confirmation** (usually 30 seconds)
7. **Verification complete** - can now use your application

### **For Administrators:**
1. **Install eVerify package** (one-time setup)
2. **Configure database** (one-time setup)
3. **Add verify button** to your application
4. **Monitor verifications** through database reports
5. **Handle your own data** in your application's database
